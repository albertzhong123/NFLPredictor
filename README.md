# NFLPredictor
As of right now, the program has been able to scrape, sort, and transform the raw data into inputs that will be used in a machine learning model

This program is written in Python. It uses BeautifulSoup, pandas, requests, and other built-in libraries. The raw data parsed from https://www.pro-football-reference.com/ is converted into a ranking system, and then using applied weights, transformed into a single score. 

The goal is to build a classification supervised machine learning model using the scores gained from the transformed data.
